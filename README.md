# Chef server in a Docker container

This cookbook is wrapping [Opscode's `chef-server` cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-server) to provide a Chef server that's running in a [Docker](http://www.docker.io) container and configured by (the host's) [`etcd`](http://coreos.com/docs/etcd/).
This is made possible by [coderranger's `etcd-chef`](https://github.com/coderanger/etcd-chef), which is run by piggy-backing the Omnibus installer's process supervision tree ([runit](http://smarden.org/runit/) FTW) using its embedded `runit` cookbook.

It has been lightly tested using [CoreOS](http://coreos.com), but there's no reason it shouldn't work with "plain" Docker and `etcd`.
As of now, its raison d'Ãªtre is mainly to satisfy the author's curiosity - any suggestions, thoughts and ideas on how to properly create a reusable container are very welcome.
_This is not a battle-tested solution_ (yet).

## Build the container

Adjust the way the chef-server Omnibus package finds its way into the container in the `Dockerfile`.

1. `git clone git://github.com/srenatus/chef-server-etcd.git`
2. set your host's IP of `etcd_host` in `chef-server-etcd/config.rb`
3. `docker build -rm -t chef/server chef-server-etcd/`

## Use the container

1. get the container (i.e. build it or pull it from your repository)
2. post your `api_fqdn` value to `etcd` (see below)
3. `docker run -v /tmp/logs:/var/log/chef-server sr/chefserveretcd` - note that the first run executes the first `chef-server-ctl reconfigure` of the Omnibus package and thus takes a while.  You can monitor its logs in `/tmp/logs/etcd-chef/current`.
4. fetch your new Chef server's `admin.pem` and `chef-validator.pem` from `etcd`, e.g.

    ```
    curl -LO http://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/linux64/jq 
    chmod +x jq
    curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/v1/keys/chef-server/admin.pem  | ./jq -r .value > admin.pem
    curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/v1/keys/chef-server/chef-validator.pem  | ./jq -r .value > chef-validator.pem
    curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/v1/keys/chef-server/knife.rb  | ./jq -r .value > knife.rb
    ```

5. setup your Chef toolchain to use your new Chef server...

### Etcd

As of now, the only configuration value that is used is `node['chef-server']['configuration']['api_fqdn']`, set via `/v1/keys/chef-server/configuration/api_fqdn`:

```
curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/v1/keys/chef-server/configuration/api_fqdn -d value="172.17.42.1"
```

Setting it to the host's IP address, and forwarding a port to the container's port 443 is all that is needed to try this.

Thanks to `etcd-chef`, any changes to this value will trigger a `chef-solo` run inside the container.

## The bootstrap process

1. get and install Omnibus Chef server `.deb`
2. import cookbook `chef-server-etcd`
3. use Omnibus' `chef-solo` to continue bootstrapping via `chef-server-etcd::setup`,
    - getting the `chef-server` cookbook
    - preparing various work arounds
    - installing a `runit_service` using the Omnibus' embedded `runit` cookbook
    - setting the default container `CMD` to the Omnibus package's runsvdir-start,
        - which will first start the `etcd-chef` service,
        - which will pull the configuration from `etcd` and
        - have the `chef-server` cookbook prepare the rest of the supervision tree (as usual with the Omnibus package)

Using the `chef-server` cookbook (respectively the Omnibus package) in a Docker container is by default facing the problem that it tries to start (via Upstart) the `chef-server-runsvdir` job, which will supervise the `/opt/chef-server/service` directory.
The same effect is achieved here by starting the `runsvdir-script` manually and having one of its services (`etcd-chef`) trigger the rest.
